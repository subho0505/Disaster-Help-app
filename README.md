# 🌐 Disaster Help App

## 📌 Overview

Disaster Help App is an **Android-based emergency assistance system** built using **Java**. It leverages **real-time GPS tracking**, **Firebase Realtime Database**, and Android location services to provide quick disaster response and help management. The app collects user location data during emergencies and updates it dynamically for immediate rescue coordination.

## 🚀 Features

* 📍 **Real-Time Location Tracking** using FusedLocationProviderClient
* 🌍 **Reverse Geocoding** to convert coordinates into human-readable addresses
* 🔄 **Live Location Updates** with customizable update intervals
* ☁️ **Firebase Realtime Database Integration** for storing and retrieving SOS data
* 🛑 **Emergency Mode Toggle** to activate/deactivate disaster help alerts
* 🔔 **Dynamic Notifications & UI Updates** for quick response

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Framework:** Android SDK
* **Database:** Firebase Realtime Database
* **Services:** Google Play Location Services, Geocoder API

## 📲 How It Works

1. The user enables emergency mode via a switch.
2. The app fetches the current GPS coordinates.
3. The location is converted to an address using Geocoder.
4. Data is pushed to **Firebase** for real-time monitoring.
5. Rescue teams or other users can access the data for quick help deployment.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subho0505/Disaster-Help-app.git
   ```
2. Open in **Android Studio**.
3. Add your **Firebase configuration file (google-services.json)**.
4. Build and run on an Android device/emulator.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Integrate **SMS Alerts** for network failure situations.
* Add **multi-user rescue coordination dashboard**.
* Implement **AI-based disaster prediction and alerting system**.
